# The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
# 
# n -> n/2 (n is even)
# n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)
# 
# Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
# 
# 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
# 
# It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. 
# Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers 
# finish at 1.
# 
# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
# 
# NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
